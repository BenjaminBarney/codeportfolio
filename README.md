Some small examples of my work I have put together

CSharpQuickSelfUpdater.txt contains some cherry-picked functions I wrote to allow a piece of software running on Point Of Sale systems to self-update when the machine is first booted up and logged into. This code is a work in progress, and will no doubt improve over time.

JavascriptExcercises.txt contains some examples of me doing coding excersizes from CodeWars.com. It is something I did to get ready for an interview, but it was a good example both ofmy ability to use vanilla javascript and to think through a solution to a coding problem, so I decided to upload it.

Thank you for your attention!
